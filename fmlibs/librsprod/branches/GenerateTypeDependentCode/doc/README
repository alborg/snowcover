This file was created 2008-04-14 as a place-holder for a documentation -- Thomas Lavergne, met.no/FoU.

Until a proper documentation is written, you can refer to the SYNOPSYS and PSEUDO-CODE EXAMPLES in 
file README (top-level directory).

Also to the test/ directory which contains examples of simple programs using librsprod.

This README file should be updated soon...

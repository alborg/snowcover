NAME:
libfmutil

PURPOSE:
Utility functions for processing satellite and radar imagery.

REQUIREMENTS:
o PROJ.4 (will compile without, but with disabled functionality)
o Some m4cros are required to build the library. These are not part of the
  software distribution, but have to be downloaded seperately at this time.

NOTES:
Check out the User Manual provided in Open Document and PDF formats within
the doc directory. 

For the impatient:
    1. cvs export -r HEAD -d commonM4cros metnoBuildCommon/m4cros
    2. autoreconf --install --verbose
    3. ./configure --help
    4. ./configure <use the proper options for your system>
    5. make
    6. make check
    7. make install

USE:
If PROJ.4 functionality is required, e.g. by using functions defined
within fmcoord.h, either "-D HAVE_LIBPROJ" should be added to compilator
flags of the application or "#define HAVE_LIBPROJ" should be added within
the code (either within a header file or in source code itself).

e.g. gcc mytst.c -D HAVE_LIBPROJ -lfmutil -lproj -lm
